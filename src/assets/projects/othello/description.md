A game of Othello. It was a bonus exercise for the course *TIEA2120 Web GUI programming* at JYU.

Make moves by dragging the disk under player's names into a legal square, which are highlighted on the board. Potentially captured disks are highlighted when calculating your move.

Also works on mobile! Touch is enough, no need for drag 'n drop.
