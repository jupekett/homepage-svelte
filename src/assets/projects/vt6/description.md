A frontend for displaying and manipulating data from a rogaining contest. 
Built as an exercise for the course *TIEA2120 Web GUI programming at JYU*.

Teams can be added and modified, with input  verification in place.
Checkpoint codes and coordinates can be modified. Utilizes [Leaflet-library](https://leafletjs.com/)
with [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) tiles to display a tiny map when clicking on checkpoint coordinates.
The checkpoint marker can then be drag 'n dropped, which updates teams' points and distances.
