const e=`# Renovation madness vs. inspiring studies

Being able to continue studying and working from home like normal even during Corona is something I'm thankful about.
I feel that I haven't had to compromise my course choices or work performance at all.
To add to the mix, our apartment is currently in the middle of a two-week renovation project.
Luckily that hasn't had much impact either, aside from being "moving house in-place" kind of a maneuver.
After this mild ordeal the boxes can finally be unpacked and spring enjoyed in an updated environment.

Speaking of spring: plans for this semester's courses are looking great so far! Programming web-servers with python, learning DevSecOps practices, and dipping my toes in machine learning sure sound fascinating and useful.
Can't wait to apply those future skills to practice.
