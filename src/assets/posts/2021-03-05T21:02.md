# To the clouds and beyond

The coming summer will be one of constant learning and brand new exciting challenges, as I received a new job!
I won't disclose the position quite yet, but I will once I start working officially.
That said, the title of this blog post might be a subtle hint about the branch of IT I will be focusing on.
I'm humbled and relieved, because then I can put to test everything I have learned so far, and "conquer some new frontiers".

This being the case, I'm taking some of my portfolio projects on AWS offline in order to save money.
The fees have not been substantial, but any savings are good.

I wish you an inspiring and warm spring!
