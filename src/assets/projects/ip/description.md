A pseudo-humorous web application, which leverages two existing **SOAP** services to convert an IP address to uppercase words.
It was developed for the course *TIES4560 SOA and Cloud Computing* at JYU.
Idea was influenced by the style of Dan Higginbotham, author of [Clojure for the brave and true](https://www.braveclojure.com/).

Most of the source files in com.jupekett.ties4560.task1.client were generated by **JAX-WS RI**.
