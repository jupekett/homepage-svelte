const e=`# Settling in the public cloud

The past 6 months at Nordcloud Oy have been a great learning experience.
I've heard people say things like "a year in working life equals \`\${multiplier}\` years of studying", but that isn't wholly accurate.
Yes, there are a plethora of technologies, processes and facets of customer work that cannot fit in a curriculum.
Here are some things I've faced in the wild for the first time: 

- Production codebases
- Deployment technologies, such as Serverless Framework, Cloudformation, CDK, Terraform
- AWS serverless tech: Lambda, DynamoDB, SQS, SNS, API Gateway, Route53, Cloudfront
- Azure stuff: App Service, WebJobs
- Cloud debugging tools: AWS CloudWatch & X-Ray, Azure App Insights
- Jira, service desks
- Recurring meetings with customers

On the other hand, touchpoints to some of these technologies might temporarily be narrow and driven by necessity and practicality.
University courses often handle a subject at a more fundamental level than skimming through documentation and "learning as you go" during everyday tasks.
I've laid my groundwork there, and now I am able to put my skills to practice while making a difference as a part of my team. 

Luckily, my expertise will only grow over time.
We are also encouraged to study the cloud giants at a certificate level by giving access to learning platforms, and setting growth plans.
I anticipate an exciting near future for me, and will do my best to be worth the expectations.
